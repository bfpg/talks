              <h1>Talk Ideas</h1>
<p>
  Ideas for new talks are recorded through
  <a href="http://github.com/bfpg/talks/issues" target="_blank">
    Github issues
    <i class="mdi-action-launch mdi-sm"></i>
  </a>.
</p>

<h3>Submitting an Idea</h3>
<p>
  We encourage everyone to submit things that they think would be
  cool/helpful to talk about regardless of how easy or hard the topic
  is. This group is for all levels of FP proficiency and with a group
  of this size you can be guaranteed that someone else will find your
  topic of value.
</p>
<p>
  Submitting an talk idea will not automatically force you into
  presenting it yourself, but it is a highly encouraged and proven way
  to learn things. :)
</p>
<p>
  If you have an idea or see an existing idea that you are interested
  in but aren't sure whether you're up for presenting, please let
 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Functional-Programming-Group/members/?op=leaders">one
 of the execs <i class="mdi-action-launch mdi-sm"></i></a> know and we
 can help you figure that out with you. We provide lots of mentoring and
 practice runs for people that need it so you will be in good hands.
</p>
<h3>Idea States</h3>
<p>
  Talk ideas fall into one or more of the following states represented by issue tags:
  <ul>
    <li><span class="label label-warning">Needs Speaker</span> If you are interested in this topic then it is a wonderful motivation to learn about it and present it! :)</li>
    <li><span class="label label-info">Needs Scheduling</span> This has not been pencilled in for a specific meetup.</li>
    <li><span class="label label-danger">Popular Topic</span> This topic has been regularly requested and really should be talked about.</li>
    <li><span class="label label-success">Scheduled</span> This topic has been been pencilled in for a meetup. Check out when <a href="./future.html">here</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Voting for an Idea</h3>

<p>To vote for an idea, comment on the issue with a <code>:+1:</code>.</p>
<p>
  If an idea gets lots of votes then the exec will apply the
  <span class="label label-danger">Popular Topic</span> to the issue
  and it'll get prioritised in our planning.
