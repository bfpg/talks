<p>
Ideas for new talks are recorded through

</p>

<h3>Submitting an Idea</h3>
<p>
We encourage everyone to submit things that they think would be
cool/helpful to talk about regardless of how easy or hard the topic
is. This group is for all levels of FP proficiency and with a group
of this size you can be guaranteed that someone else will find your
topic of value.
</p>
<p>
Submitting a talk idea will not automatically force you into
presenting it yourself, but it is a highly encouraged and proven way
to learn things. :)
</p>
<p>
If you have an idea or see an existing idea that you are interested
in but aren't sure whether you're up for presenting, please let

   href="http://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Functional-Programming-Group/members/?op=leaders">one
   of the execs <i class="mdi-action-launch mdi-sm"></i></a> know and we
 can help you figure that out with you. We provide lots of mentoring and
 practice runs for people that need it so you will be in good hands.

Talk ideas fall into one or more of the following states represented by issue tags:
<ul>
    <li><span class="label label-warning">Needs Speaker</span> If you are

        about it and present it! :)</li>
    <li><span class="label label-info">Needs Scheduling</span> This has not
        been pencilled in for a specific meetup.</li>
    <li><span class="label label-danger">Popular Topic</span> This topic has

    <li><span class="label label-success">Scheduled</span> This topic has been

</ul>
</p>

<h3>Voting for an Idea</h3>
