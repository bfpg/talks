In Chapter 10, we introduced a simple algebraic structure, the monoid. This was
our first instance of a completely abstract, purely algebraic interface, and it
led us to think about interfaces in a new way. A useful interface may be
defined only by a collection of operations related by laws.

In Chapter 11, we’ll continue this mode of thinking and apply it to the problem
of factoring out code duplication across some of the libraries we wrote in
parts 1 and 2. We’ll discover two new abstract interfaces, Functor and Monad,
and get more general experience with spotting these sorts of abstract
structures in our code.

In Chapter 12 we’ll learn about a related abstraction, applicative functors,
which are less powerful than monads, but more general (and hence more common).
The process of arriving at applicative functors will also provide some insight
into how to discover such abstractions, and we’ll use some of these ideas to
uncover another useful abstraction, traversable functors. It may take some time
for the full significance and usefulness of these abstractions to sink in, but
you’ll see them popping up again and again in your daily work with FP if you
pay attention.
