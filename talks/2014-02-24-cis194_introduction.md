"The Yorgey Lectures": [http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html]()

It can be hard to get starting with Haskell. Learn You a Haskell for Great Good
is often recommended, but it has no exercises. Real World Haskell is also
great, but the intermediate level of some of the content can be intimidating.

Brent Yorgey has a set of lectures that are aimed at programmers without much
functional programming experience, and they come with a great set of exercises.

This talk will cover the first of these lectures and the the associated
homework, along with a walkthrough of using GHCi for Haskell development.
