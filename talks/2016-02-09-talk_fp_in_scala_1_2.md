This is the first instalment of following through the FP in Scala book as part
of our meetups. 

Chapter 1 introduces the essence of functional programming and why we should
care about it.

Chapter 2 is a crash course in scala syntax that will get you up and running
ready to play for the next chapters.

The book has exercises in it: we're going to have time at the hack night for
people to come in, work on and get help if they need it.

If you are planning to follow along, I'd highly recommend buying the (e)book
and reading along: you'll learn better if you read and watch the talks.
