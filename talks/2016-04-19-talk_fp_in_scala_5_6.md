This talk will be a brief overview of Chapters 5 & 6 from Functional
Programming in Scala.

In Chapter 5 we look at lazy evaluation and how this can allow you to operate
over data structures of inifinite size.

In Chapter 6 we explore what it means to have state in a function program, and
discover that it really just boils down to adding another parameter to the
function and then applying an abstraction so that you can write functions that
fit together without needing to know about the plumbing.
