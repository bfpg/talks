This talk aims to be a very accessible introduction to one of the most popular
modern functional programming languages: Scala. Even those who have never come
into contact with functional programming before should find real benefits
within - particularly those who work with Java.  Scala is a popular programming
language which attempts to combine features from both object-oriented and
functional programming. As Scala compiles to JVM bytecode, it is compatible
with existing codebases written in other JVM languages, such as Java.

This talk will demonstrate some beneficial features of Scala, focusing on those
which lend themselves to a functional style of program construction. These
features include pattern matching, algebraic datatypes, and Scala's focus on
immutable data.
