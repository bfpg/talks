Wanting to make use of libraries written in other langauges (often C)
is a common situation in high-level languages, and Haskell is no
exception.  This talk will introduce and demonstrate real-world use of
Haskell's C foreign function interface (FFI), including how to deal
with some common C idioms.  We will examine the c2hs tool which
simplifies bindings and review some other Haskell FFI tools.

Attendees who are comfortable with Haskell syntax and have a passing
familiarity with C (especially pointers) will get the most out of this
presentation.
