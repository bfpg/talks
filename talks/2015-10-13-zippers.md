Immutable data-structures are the bread and butter of functional programming.
Advantages of immutability include the persistence of old versions, the
thread-safety, and the ability to reason about these structures. However,
repeatedly modifying data deep within a nested immutable structure can have
severe performance costs.

Structures known as 'zippers' allow for efficient traversal and modification of
immutable data-structures. In this beginner-to-intermediate level talk, zippers
will be motivated and introduced in Scala. A successful practical application
of zippers in the Argonaut JSON library will be examined.
