With great power comes great code. We will try to write a library with a little
help from a super hero and a powerful language (Haskell).

This talk will be of interest to anyone interested in the experience of writing
solid, principled and performant functional libraries. In particular, we will
cover writing an library for editing and traversing structured data based off
of the Weaving a web functional pearl by Ralf Hinze and Johan Jeuring.
