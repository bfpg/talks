In this talk, we will discuss what these concepts represent and how they apply
in everyday programming practices. A concrete explanation of the meaning and
motivation for each of these will be provided â€” no metaphors or handwaving.
Some of the practical consequences will be introduced by drawing on the
ubiquitous knowledge of everyday programmers.

The audience should expect to walk away with an introductory understanding and
vocabulary for these topics with a capability to directly apply this knowledge
in any programming environment and an aspiration to take this knowledge
further.
