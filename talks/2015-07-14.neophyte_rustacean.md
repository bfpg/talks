Rust is a new language that had it's first stable 1.0 release in May. Aimed at being an alternative to languages like C, C++ and Go, it is strict and impure, but is much safer than those. It borrows ideas from functional languages, and pays some attention to the last few decades of research.   

We will walk through James' first month and a half with Rust, the triumphs of seeing it prevent bugs, the despair of fighting the borrow checker, and how well it works for some common tasks.
