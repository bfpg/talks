We've seen Lists, Trees and IO.  But what have they got in common?

It turns out, lots!

In this section we'll introduce the Functor type class to allow us to write
generic functions that work for all of these types, and many more! Functor is
one of many powerful abstractions commonly used in Haskell to make our code
concise and expressive, and save us from boring repetition.
