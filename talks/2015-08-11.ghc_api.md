In his free time, Carlo wrote a tool called ghc-imported-from to help leverage the information from the compiler in code that he was writing.

In this talk Carlo will talk us through his journey, from zero code to his completed tool and the parts of the GHC API that he used along the way.

You should come away less fearful of the GHC API and maybe have a few ideas to add into tools of your own or add functionality to existing ones like ghc-mod.
