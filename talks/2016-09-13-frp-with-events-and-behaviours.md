Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is an overloaded term.

The varieties of FRP that include events and behaviors are closer on the
spectrum to the original meaning. Those systems have a lot of high value
features - well-defined semantics, great composition - but examples and
documentation probably aren't usually counted among them.

This talk will cover the basics of event-and-behavior FRP using the
reactive-banana library.

All of the basic concepts will be covered, we'll be playing around with some
interesting design opportunities that FRP allows. We'll be alternating between
looking at the FRP combinators and building up example code, as we
incrementally put together the FRP equivalent of the chat server described in
Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell.

Once we get to the end, we should be enthused, ready to give
events-and-behaviors FRP a try, and ready for Part2 ...
