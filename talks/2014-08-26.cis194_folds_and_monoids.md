'Introduction to Haskell 7 - Folds and Monoids' by George Wilson

This is the seventh instalment of Brent Yorgey's Introduction to Haskell
lectures. 

We've seen how a list can be aggregated into a single value using folds. This
lecture explores how we might create similar folds for our own data structures;
yet another example of how higher-order functions save us from repeating
ourselves. The lecture will also explore monoids, one of Haskell's most
prevalent typeclasses.
