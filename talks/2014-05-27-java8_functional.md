Java 8 introduced several new features which will make applying functional
programming principals in Java simpler, easier and more concise.

Beginning with an overview of Lambdas and the Streams library, we will then
look at how they can be used to improve the quality of Java code. We will
discuss the good parts, the parts that don't live up to what we would like, and
what it may mean in future for Java and the FP world.

A basic knowledge of Java and functional programming concepts is assumed, but
you don't have to be an expert at either.
