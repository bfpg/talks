So far we have explored data types, pattern matching, and recursive functions
in our quest to achieve functional enlightenment, but singular functions alone
are lonely things. If only we could assemble a number of functions together to
form a super function...

This month we explore methods to compose functions together, through currying
and partial application, treating them as Higher-Order functions, and
eventually exploring folds. Through this we can reduce the complexity and
amount of code we write in common patterns by combining pre-made
implementations with application-specific code.
