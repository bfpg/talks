Parser combinators - functions to assemble big parsers from little ones - are
an instructive example of composability and reuse made possible through FP, and
building one is a useful (and common!) exercise for learners seeking through
practical application a solid understanding of abstractions such as applicative
functors and monads.

In this talk, we will briefly examine some parsing libraries available for
Haskell and discuss their relative benefits and drawbacks. Then we will ignore
everything we just saw and build a parser combinator library from scratch.
Moreover, our parser will be abstracted over the "whole" and "element" input
types - a more general result than most parsers.

I will conclude with a summary of some topics for further study including
important parser design decisions, optimisations and efforts to unify parsing
and pretty printing.
