Functors are ubiquitous in modern strongly-typed functional programming. Every
Haskell beginner will come across them as one of the first typeclasses
introduced. Stronger structures such as Applicative and Monad often steal the
spotlight, but there are many structures related to the humble Functor that go
unnoticed. The goal of this talk is to show off and give an intuition for some
of these other structures: contravariant functors, bifunctors, and profunctors.
With some of these making their way into Haskell's standard library recently,
now is a perfect time to be introduced to or brush up on these concepts. Code
examples will use Haskell, but these techniques extend to any language with
typeclasses or a similar mechanism, such as Scala's implicits.
