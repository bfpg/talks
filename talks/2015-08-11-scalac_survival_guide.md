BIO: Jason Zaugg once tinkered with the Scala compiler, got hooked, and now
works full time on the Scala language at Typesafe.

As a programmer, tinkering with the implementation of the very language you
work with (and think in) a uniquely satisfying endeavour. Scala offers lots of
avenues to try this: you can author compiler plugins to perform static
analysis, use macros to generate boilerplate, or modify the compiler to fix
bugs or implement your own pet feature. More generally, thinking about the
meta-aspects of the language invariably lead to a fresh perspective and deeper
understanding that benefit your regular coding, too.

But all of these tasks can at times seem daunting, infuriating, or out of
reach. This talk will issue you with the map, compass, flashlight, and roll of
duct tape that you need to embark on this journey. It is drawn from the tools
and techniques that I use on a daily basis when I'm working on the compiler.

Bring a Scala 2.11.6 REPL along if you want to code along, or skim the
Reflection and Macro guides if you want to get a head start on some of the
concepts we'll touch upon, or check out or Hacker's and Contributing guide to
plan your first pull request.
