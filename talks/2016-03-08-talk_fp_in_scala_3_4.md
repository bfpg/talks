*Chapter 3: Functional Data Structures*

In this chapter, we'll learn the concept of functional data structures and how
to work with them. We'll use this as an opportunity to introduce how data types
are defined in functional programming, learn about the related technique of
pattern matching, and get practice writing and generalizing pure functions.

*Chapter 4: Functional Error Handling*

In this chapter, we'll learn the basic principles for raising and handling
errors functionally. The big idea is that we can represent failures and
exceptions with ordinary values, and we can write higher-order functions that
abstract out common patterns of error handling and recovery.
