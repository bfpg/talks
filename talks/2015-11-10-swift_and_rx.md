Making iOS applications can be a tricky mess of callbacks and fiddly resource
deallocation. In this talk we will look at swift and the swift reactive
extensions to see how functional programming can tame these challenges.

This talk will be code example focused but will require no prior knowledge of
iOS dev or Rx.
