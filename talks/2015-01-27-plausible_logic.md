Many people have the impressive skill of common sense. Logics which emulate
certain aspects of common sense fall within the field of non-monotonic
reasoning.

For his Honours thesis, George Wilson completed a Haskell implementation of a
non-monotonic logic called Plausible Logic. In this talk, George will give a
very brief introduction to non-monotonic reasoning before diving into some of
the code. He will discuss his experience working with and adapting an existing
Haskell codebase, much of which was a decade old.
