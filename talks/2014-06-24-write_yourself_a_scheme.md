'Write Yourself a Scheme' in 48 hours by Sean Chalmers

A dive into the experience of creating a Lisp implementation in Haskell.

Taken from the book of the same name, this presentation will provide some
insight into what is needed to get started, how to avoid some pain along the
way, and why undertaking this project is a good idea for anyone looking to hone
their Haskell skills.
