This talk outlines how a beginner taking the CIS 194 course can
prepare to use Haskell in real world projects. Take away lessons
include pitfalls to avoid, struggles one might face on the
transition from learner to practitioner and how to contribute to
the Haskell community.

Roman is a software engineer at Red Hat, working on internal
tools. His every day language is mainly Python. He has used
XMonad for 6 years but never grokked how to configure the window
manager and its components.  Until now.
