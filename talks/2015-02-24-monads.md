Over the last couple of yorgey lectures, we have seen how the
Applicative class allows us to idiomatically handle computations which
take place in some sort of "special context" -- for example, taking into
account possible failure with Maybe, multiple possible outputs with
[], consulting some sort of environment using ((->) e), or construct
parsers using a "combinator" approach, as in the homework.

However, so far we have only seen computations with a fixed structure,
such as applying a data constructor to a fixed set of arguments. What
if we don't know the structure of the computation in advance -- that
is, we want to be able to decide what to do based on some intermediate
results?
