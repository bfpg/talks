Representing data as code and vice versa has a long history in functional
programming and language theory. I'll present some techniques for changing how
functions and data are represented that have significant engineering impact.
The main technique I hope to communicate is the 'finally tagless' approach to
EDSL implementation (and the associated engineering tradeoffs).
