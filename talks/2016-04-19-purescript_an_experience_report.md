title: Purescript - An Experience Report

One of the first tasks that I got asked to do at Ephox was to construct a proof
of concept new feature in one of our editors. This involved integrating an open
source library that kinda met the mark, changing and building up new code
around it until it became a viable tool for exploring  the idea with
non-technical staff and customers.

As someone hired as a Scala developer and devops guy too far lost into the pure
FP coolaid, I quickly found myself ill-equipped to develop complicated new
features on the base of mutabily, no types and unbridled side effects.

This talk outlines Ben's experiences and learnings going from a javascript
feature codebase codebase and replacing it with purescript. It won't teach you
how to code purescript, but it should share enough war stories and insight to
help you make the decision to learn and use it yourself.

Unfortunately given that the PoC was for a brand new feature Ben cannot share
the actual code or talk about the feature in detail, but we'll hopefully have
enough contrived examples to convey the message. If not, I'm happy to answer
lots of questions if there are gaps.
