Andrew McCluskey will be continuing our FP in Scala series, covering chapters 9
and 10. Chapter 9 brings part two to its conclusion with an example of
algebraic design applied to a parser combinator library. Algebraic design
focuses on identifying the abstract data types, operations over them, and laws
that constrain them - the algebra - before considering a concrete
implementation. Andrew will take you through the process at a high level and
briefly discuss his experiences working through the chapter.

What do concatenating strings, adding integers, and parallel computations have
in common? Andrew will explain in the second half of his talk, as he takes you
through chapter 10. Chapter 10 covers Monoids, and is the first in part three
of the book, which introduces some common patterns in functional programming
and develops them into algebraic abstractions. While this might seem more
theoretical than practical, Andrew plans on convincing you otherwise. He'll
start by briefly covering why developing these abstractions is a useful thing
to do and then dive into what a Monoid is, providing concrete examples as he
goes.
